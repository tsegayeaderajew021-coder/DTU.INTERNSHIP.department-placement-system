# Student Placement Dashboard

A React-based admin portal for managing student placements, departments, bulk data import, system configuration, and audit logs.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — React application source code
- `public/` — public assets and HTML template
- `import_api.php` — backend endpoint for import uploads
- `departments_api.php` — department management backend
- `users_api.php` — user management backend

## Development Setup

This project is split between a frontend React app and a PHP backend.

### Frontend

Use PowerShell in the frontend folder:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\hp\student-placement> npm install
PS C:\Users\hp\student-placement> npm start
```

The React app runs at:

- `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend

Use PowerShell in the XAMPP htdocs folder:

```powershell
PS C:\xampp1\htdocs\placment_backend>
```

Make sure the following PHP files are located inside `C:\xampp1\htdocs\placment_backend`:

- `users_api.php`
- `departments_api.php`
- `import_api.php`

Then start Apache from XAMPP.

The backend API base is:

- `http://localhost/placment_backend`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.

## API Usage

The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://localhost/placment_backend`.

### Import endpoint

- `POST /import_api.php`
- Accepts `multipart/form-data`
- Fields:
  - `dataFile` — uploaded CSV file
